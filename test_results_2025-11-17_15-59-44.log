Response: Employees experiencing medical emergencies may be allowed to work from home for up to two weeks, provided they can operate effectively and have explicit approval from their manager and HR. This provision requires supporting documentation and is not applicable if management or HR judges the employee incapable of effective operation. For employees recovering from a medical condition, working from home for up to two weeks may be permitted based on written medical advice and manager approval, considering business and client deliverables. If remote work impacts project timelines or delivery commitments, employees are expected to apply for paid or unpaid leave as applicable.
